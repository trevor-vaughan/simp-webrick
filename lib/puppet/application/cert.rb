puppet-cert(8) -- #{summary}
========

SYNOPSIS
--------
Standalone certificate authority. Capable of generating certificates,
but mostly used for signing certificate requests from puppet clients.


USAGE
-----
puppet cert <action> [-h|--help] [-V|--version] [-d|--debug] [-v|--verbose]
  [--digest <digest>] [<host>]


DESCRIPTION
-----------
Because the puppet master service defaults to not signing client
certificate requests, this script is available for signing outstanding
requests. It can be used to list outstanding requests and then either
sign them individually or sign all of them.

ACTIONS
-------

Every action except 'list' and 'generate' requires a hostname to act on,
unless the '--all' option is set.

The most important actions for day-to-day use are 'list' and 'sign'.

* clean:
  Revoke a host's certificate (if applicable) and remove all files
  related to that host from puppet cert's storage. This is useful when
  rebuilding hosts, since new certificate signing requests will only be
  honored if puppet cert does not have a copy of a signed certificate
  for that host. If '--all' is specified then all host certificates,
  both signed and unsigned, will be removed.

* fingerprint:
  Print the DIGEST (defaults to the signing algorithm) fingerprint of a
  host's certificate.

* generate:
  Generate a certificate for a named client. A certificate/keypair will
  be generated for each client named on the command line.

* list:
  List outstanding certificate requests. If '--all' is specified, signed
  certificates are also listed, prefixed by '+', and revoked or invalid
  certificates are prefixed by '-' (the verification outcome is printed
  in parenthesis). If '--human-readable' or '-H' is specified,
  certificates are formatted in a way to improve human scan-ability. If
  '--machine-readable' or '-m' is specified, output is formatted concisely
  for consumption by a script.

* print:
  Print the full-text version of a host's certificate.

* revoke:
  Revoke the certificate of a client. The certificate can be specified either
  by its serial number (given as a hexadecimal number prefixed by '0x') or by its
  hostname. The certificate is revoked by adding it to the Certificate Revocation
  List given by the 'cacrl' configuration option. Note that the puppet master
  needs to be restarted after revoking certificates.

* sign:
  Sign an outstanding certificate request. If '--interactive' or '-i' is
  supplied the user will be prompted to confirm that they are signing the
  correct certificate (recommended). If '--assume-yes' or '-y' is supplied
  the interactive prompt will assume the answer of 'yes'.

* verify:
  Verify the named certificate against the local CA certificate.

* reinventory:
  Build an inventory of the issued certificates. This will destroy the current
  inventory file specified by 'cert_inventory' and recreate it from the
  certificates found in the 'certdir'. Ensure the puppet master is stopped
  before running this action.

OPTIONS
-------
Note that any setting that's valid in the configuration
file is also a valid long argument. For example, 'ssldir' is a valid
setting, so you can specify '--ssldir <directory>' as an
argument.

See the configuration file documentation at
https://docs.puppetlabs.com/puppet/latest/reference/configuration.html for the
full list of acceptable parameters. A commented list of all
configuration options can also be generated by running puppet cert with
'--genconfig'.

* --all:
  Operate on all items. Currently only makes sense with the 'sign',
  'list', and 'fingerprint' actions.

* --allow-dns-alt-names:
  Sign a certificate request even if it contains one or more alternate DNS
  names. If this option isn't specified, 'puppet cert sign' will ignore any
  requests that contain alternate names.

  In general, ONLY certs intended for a Puppet master server should include
  alternate DNS names, since Puppet agent relies on those names for identifying
  its rightful server.

  You can make Puppet agent request a certificate with alternate names by
  setting 'dns_alt_names' in puppet.conf or specifying '--dns_alt_names' on the
  command line. The output of 'puppet cert list' shows any requested alt names
  for pending certificate requests.

* --allow-authorization-extensions:
  Enable the signing of a request with authorization extensions. Such requests
  are sensitive because they can be used to write access rules in Puppet Server.
  Currently, this is the only means by which such requests can be signed.

* --digest:
  Set the digest for fingerprinting (defaults to the digest used when
  signing the cert). Valid values depends on your openssl and openssl ruby
  extension version.

* --debug:
  Enable full debugging.

* --help:
  Print this help message

* --verbose:
  Enable verbosity.

* --version:
  Print the puppet version number and exit.

    $ puppet cert list
    culain.madstop.com
    $ puppet cert sign culain.madstop.com
